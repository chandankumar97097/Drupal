🎗️ Drupal Multisite Setup🎗️ 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    
Hi we are creating drupal 8 multisite in our local machine.
👉️Initial steps to follow..
📌️Under /sites replicate the example.site.php and rename to sites.php
📌️Create an array in php named $sites.
<?php  $sites=array('webshop.local.site1' =>'site1', 'webshop.local.site2'=>'site2' ); ?>
📌️Now create the directories[site1 & site2] under /sites with the same name as in array values.
📌️Now we have to create settings and services file in both the directories.To do that replicate default.services.yml and default.settings.php from the /default to both the directories and rename them to remove 'default.' from respective names.
📌️Create the virtual host for those two subdomain [webshop.local.site1] & webshop.local.site2] with the same as array keys.
📌️Now visit two url http://webshop.local.site1 & https://webshop.local.site2
📌️Create Bothe Database and hit the url and install.
